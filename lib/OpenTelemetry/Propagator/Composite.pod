=head1 NAME

OpenTelemetry::Propagator::Composite - A composite context propagator for OpenTelemetry

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenTelemetry::Propagator::Composite;
    use OpenTelemetry::Propagator::Baggage;
    use OpenTelemetry::Propagator::TraceContext;

    my $propagator = OpenTelemetry::Propagator::Composite->new(
        OpenTelemetry::Propagator::Baggage->new,
        OpenTelemetry::Propagator::TraceContext->new,
    );

    # Inject data from the context to a carrier using all injectors in order
    my $carrier = {};
    $propagator->inject( $carrier, $context );

    # Extract data from a carrier to the context using all extractors in order
    my $new_context = $propagator->extract( $carrier, $context );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package defines a propagator class that interact with the context
(which can be either an implicit or explicit instance of
L<OpenTelemetry::Context>) and inject or extract data using a composite of
objects implementing the L<OpenTelemetry::Propagator> interface. Injectors
and extractors can be set separately, and will be called in order when they
are used.

This composite propagator itself implements the L<OpenTelemetry::Propagator>
interface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $propagator = OpenTelemetry::Propagator::Composite->new(@propagators)

Constructs a new instance of this propagator. Takes a potentially empty list
of objects that implement the L<OpenTelemetry::Propagator> interface. Calls
to C<inject> and C<extract> will be delegated to these in the order they were
specified.
