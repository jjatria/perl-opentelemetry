    # the no-op logger before we've set up a real logger provider
    # that can generate real loggers, we'll be stuck with a no-op.

    # in d9e321bd1bf65d510b12ef34fe2b5a0c51da0bf2, although the

    # have to come up with a way to make sure its delegate continues
    # to point to the right place even if the tracer provider changes
