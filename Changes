Revision history for OpenTelemetry

{{$NEXT}}

    * Fixed an issue with experimental cleanup where "DBI::db::execute"
      was replaced with "DBI::db::do" by mistake (GH #17)

0.022     2024-05-12 20:08:13+01:00 Europe/London

    * Fixed a minor rendering issue in the documentation of the HTTP
      integrations, and added a "See Also" section to both.

0.021     2024-05-10 19:21:15+01:00 Europe/London

    * Leave the status of a span unset on success responses in the
      HTTP::Tiny and LWP::UserAgent integrations. This behaviour matches
      the OpenTelemetry specification.
    * Fixed an issue in the HTTP::Tiny integration where the content size
      of requests with a content callback was incorrectly reported. It is
      now not reported at all.
    * Expand and update documentation of HTTP integrations.

0.020     2024-04-25 18:54:56+01:00 Europe/London

    * Switch LWP::UserAgent integration to wrap around that module's
      'simple_request' method instead of its 'request' method. This
      should catch some more cases, and fix GH #13.
    * Added a minimal example application. See the `examples` directory
      in the distribution files.

0.019     2023-12-03 14:44:05+00:00 Europe/London

    * Document OpenTelemetry->logger as deprecated, as this will soon
      be removed to make room for the implementation of the Logs API.
    * Apply default values appropriately when receiving undefined values
    * The HTTP::Tiny and LWP::UserAgent integrations inject propagation
      data as appropriate
    * Bump dependency on Feature::Compat::Try to 0.05 for finally support
      in perl versions under 5.35 (GH #11)

0.018     2023-11-23 19:28:38+00:00 Europe/London

    * Document all shutdown and force_flush methods as async

0.017     2023-11-19 12:39:37+00:00 Europe/London

    * Undo conditional logic in Tracer's in_span introduced in 0.016.
      The span is read-only, so we cannot read its status. We now set
      the status unconditionally, but the user is free to mark the span
      as ended, in which case the automatically set status will be
      discarded.

0.016     2023-11-16 23:37:27+00:00 Europe/London

    * Fix issue tracker link in meta
    * Try to limit information set as span error descriptions in
      integrations. Instead of passing in the entire, which could
      have multiple lines and contextual information, we trim and
      pass only the first line, without the trailing `at line #`
      added from eg. plain `die`. This error is still set unmodified
      as the exception.
    * Injection and extraction methods for processors catch errors
      from their callbacks as required by
      https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/error-handling/#guidance
    * Validate initial values for TraceContext::TraceFlags: they
      must be in the 0-255 range (inclusive) or they are ignored
    * The Tracer's experimental in_span interface now automatically
      sets the status of the span as long as the span's status remains
      unset at the end of the block

0.015     2023-11-09 23:42:47+00:00 Europe/London

    * Add -span and -trace export tags to OpenTelemetry::Constants
    * Add tests for OpenTelemetry::Constants
    * Add otel_config to OpenTelemetry exportable functions

0.014     2023-11-09 00:01:05+00:00 Europe/London

    * Add missing documentation for the 'record_exception' method
      for spans
    * OpenTelemetry::X errors print stack traces when stringified
    * Improve the reporting of errors caught in calls to
      'in_span' in OpenTelementry::Trace
    * Minor documentation fixes throughout

0.013     2023-11-07 20:23:49+00:00 Europe/London

    * Add support for a `details` parameter to the error handler
      for passing additional structured context data

0.012     2023-11-05 18:29:49+00:00 Europe/London

    * Fix the documentation for OpenTelemetry::Common::config, which
      incorrectly stated the order variables are read in
    * Added otel_untraced_context to OpenTelemetry exportable functions

0.011     2023-11-01 23:18:14+00:00 Europe/London

    * Added missing documentation for
      OpenTelemetry::Propagator::TraceContext::TraceState
    * Publicly index existing OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::Status
    * Fix other minor issues in the documentation

0.010     2023-10-31 23:05:38+00:00 Europe/London

    Added Tracing API implementation.

0.001     2020-06-29 00:03:29+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
